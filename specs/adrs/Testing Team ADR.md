# Testing Team ADR

## Doing research on testing
In the beginning we don't know what testing is all about, so we just browsed and seek information.  

## Getting a list of several optional frameworks
After having a brief idea of what testing should be doing, we decided to get a quick start on settling down a list of frameworks we can use. </br>
The frameworks we considered using are:
 - Jest
 - MochaJS
 - Jasmine
 - Nightwatch</br>
After consideration, we decided to choose one from Jest and MochaJS to be our main testing framework. 

## Considered Options

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Minimal configuration and setup. Standard syntax with documentation support. Very fast and highly performant
* [MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/) - Accurate reporting. Since it is old, lots of tutorial and documents are available online.
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - Offers an elegant programming style & patterns. Strong documentation and community support. 
* [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/) - The easiest set up, only need to import the Selenium library. The language is very simple as well.


## Final Decision

Chosen option: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), because

* It's convenient for smaller projects, which fits the characteristics of our project.
* We will go over Jest during lectures and labs, by choosing Jest we can directly take advantage from the course material. 
* Sanat recommended Jest.
